# Connect-to-Faculty
 Connect to Faculty is a web-based system that allows students to
 check faculty availability, view timetables, and see important messages
 without personal contact. Faculty can update their status (Available,
 Busy, On Leave), schedules, and post important announcements for
 students. The system improves communication and helps students
 plan their interactions efficiently.
